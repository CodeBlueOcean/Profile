Question #1
What attribute and value can you use to cause an <a> element to open the link in a new browser tab? 

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a/" target="_blank">Mozilla</a>
    </head>

Question #2
How can you use the lang attribute if you have a webpage that uses more than one language? For example, let's say it has one <section> element where the contents are in French, and another <section> element where the contents are in Japanese. What can you do in this case?

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <body>
       <section>
        <h2>French</h2>
        <section lang="fr">Some French Text</section>
       
        <h2>Japanese</h2>
        <section lang="jp">Some French Text</section>
       </section>
   </body>
</html>

Question #3
One of the possible values for the name attribute of the meta element is description. How is a meta element with this attribute value used?

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta name="description" content="Free Web tutorials for HTML and CSS, initial-scale=1.0">
</head>
